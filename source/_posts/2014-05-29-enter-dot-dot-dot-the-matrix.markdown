My latest cool acquisition: a [32x32 RGB LED matrix panel](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1484).  I just got this in the mail today and really look forward to playing around with it.  At $40, it's certainly not the cheapest thing I've bought, and I don't really have a project in mind for it yet.  I was thinking of maybe doing a Conway's Game of Life simulator on it or maybe some other cellular automata; there are a lot of cool lesser known one's out there.  I'll just have to see if anything strikes my fancy.
